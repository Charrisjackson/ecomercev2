# PROJECT OVERVIEW:
 - Welcome to Carmani's! Here are all the tools we believe that you need, in order to be a successful beginner developer. Our team utilized React.js, Node.js, CSS, Javascript and MYSQL, to create the user-friendly, responsive design displayed on this webpage. With the use of React components, we have created a more reusable code base, making our open-source React code easier to integrate into your very own project, and even understand it!
 - Our code is filled with comments, with the hope that beginner and experienced developers have an easier time navigating and understanding the thought process behind the production.
 - On the contact page, we give users the opportunity to reach out to us with any concerns, ranging from products to development processes, via our form(which we validated using JavaScript).
